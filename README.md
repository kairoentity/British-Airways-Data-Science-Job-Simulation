# British Airways Data Science Job Simulation on Forage - March 2025

 * Completed a simulation focussing on how data science is a critical component
   of British Airways success
 * Scraped and analysed customer review data to uncover findings
 * Built a predictive model to understand factors that influence buying
   behaviour


## The virtual Internship is divided into two main tasks:

1. Web scraping to gain company insights
2. Predicting customer buying behaviour

### Task 1 - Web scraping to gain company insights

	•	Data Collection: Scrape airline reviews from Skytrax using Python. Store the data in a “data” folder.
	•	Data Cleaning & Analysis: Preprocess text data and perform sentiment analysis, topic modeling, or word clouds to extract insights.
	•	Presentation: Summarize findings in a single PowerPoint slide with key metrics and visualizations.

### Task 2: Predicting customer buying behaviour

	•	Data Exploration & Preparation: Analyze the dataset using Jupyter Notebook, explore columns, compute basic statistics, and create new features to improve predictive modeling.
	•	Model Training: Train a machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest) to predict customer bookings while ensuring interpretability of feature importance.
	•	Evaluation & Presentation: Assess model performance using cross-validation and evaluation metrics, visualize feature impact, and summarize insights in a PowerPoint slide.
